# Issues / Other

Besides using the five-thrity-eight github repo for this project, I also pulled information from the following sites: https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D which is where I got the information of black poverty rates. 

Hate Crimes, by year, pulled from the FBI at the following sources:
