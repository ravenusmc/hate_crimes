      <h1>Project Purpose</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to investigate hate crimes across the U.S. as a data science project. However, the user is encouraged not to take the findings in this project for fact. The reason being is that I have never taking a formal data science class. Thus, some of the findings in this project may not be accurate. I will state that I will try my hardest to make the results as accurate as possible. Thus, in conclusion, the main purpose of this project is to improve my skills with Pandas and data science in general.
